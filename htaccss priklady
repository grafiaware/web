I made some changes to @anubhava's response to working on localhost and with friendly URLs.

Directory structure:

    / (localhost root folder)
        myapp/
            public/
            index.php
        core/
            some core files ...

myapp/.htaccess (myapp root folder)

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /myapp

RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /public/([^\s?]*) [NC]
RewriteRule ^ %1 [L,NE,R=302]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/index.php?$1 [L,QSA]

myapp/public/.htaccess

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?$1 [L,QSA]

myapp/public/index.php

<?php
echo 'Hello<br>';
echo $_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];
